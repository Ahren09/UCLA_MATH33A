## 3.1 Subspaces of ‚Ñù<sup>n</sup> and their Dimensions
### Finding Kernel of a Matrix (AKA Null Space)
1. rref(A)
2. Write the non-pivot columns of rref(A) as their own column vectors, separated by commas, in order
3. Multiply each of these column vectors by -1
4. Append the identity matrix to the bottom of these column vectors such that their number of rows equals the number of columns in A
