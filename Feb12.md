## Subspaces
* Notation: V ⊆ ℝ<sup>n</sup>
  * V is a subspace of ℝ<sup>n</sup>
* B = {v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>m</sub>}
* For every v in V, there exist unique numbers (with respect to B) c<sub>1</sub>, ..., c<sub>m</sub> such that v=c<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>+c<sub>m</sub>v<sub>m</sub> where c values are B-coordinates of V
* Notation: [v]<sub>B</sub> = 
  ```
  | c_1 |
  | ... |
  | c_m |
  ```
* Another basis for ℝ<sup>2</sup>: 
  ```
  B =  { | 2 |   | 0 | }
         | 0 | , | 2 |
  ```
  * Then for v = 
  ```
  | x |
  | y |
  ```
    * We have that v = (x/2)v<sub>1</sub>+(y/2)v<sub>2</sub>
    * Means:
      ```
      [v]_b = | x/2 |
              | y/2 |
      ```
