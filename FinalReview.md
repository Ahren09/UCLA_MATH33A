# Math 33A: Linear Algebra - Final Exam Review
## 5.1: Orthogonal Projections and Orthonormal Bases
* Angle between two vectors: `cosθ = (u·v) / (|u||v|)`
* Vectors are orthogonal when their dot product is 0
* Unit vector: a vector that has length of 1
### Orthogonal Projection onto a Subspace
* We want to project vector x onto a subspace spanned by multiple vectors
* Create a matrix A out of the vectors being spanned, then find A<sup>T</sup>
* Find A<sup>T</sup>A and A<sup>T</sup>x
