## Overview
### Subspaces
#### Definition
Given a subset V of R<sup>n</sup>, how do we check if it is a subspace or not?
* To show it is a subspace, verify:
  1. For all x and y, x+y exists in V
  2. For all x, x exists in V. Also, for any constant λ, λx exists in V.
  * Suggestion to satisfy both of these conditions at once: pick two random x and y in V and show that λx + μy exist in V.
* To show it is not a subspace, it is enough to demonstrate that for either one of the two above conditions fail.
##### Remark
If V is a subspace of R<sup>n</sup>, then 0 is in V. 

If 0 is not in V, V cannot be a subspace.
